# Project Audit

> Use this document as a basis for outlining and planning your front-end build.

You can initially fill this out *before* the build of your project, and then update it as you move through to have an at-a-glance list of information that you can constantly evaluate.

## Introduction:

1. Define all definitions, acronyms and abbreviations to be used in the document
1. Goals
1. Target Audience
1. List and prioritize all mobile platforms your app is intended for
1. List and prioritize all devices and OS versions your app is intended for
1. List all technologies that should be used for building your app
1. List major milestones (from analysis, prototyping, and pre-release to app store placement), their due dates and/or desired timeframe for proof of concept/delivery


## Info

> Name, URL, additional site-specific info.

- Name:
- URL:

## Browser Support:

> What browsers will the site support?

- [] Safari (v: ?)
- [] FireFox (v: ?)
- [] Chrome (v: ?)
- [] IE (v: ?)


## Requirements

- [] Usability (screens, view modes, menus, etc)
- [] Appâ€™s collaboration with the server, including detailed description of the app-server interaction mechanism, protocols and likewise data

## Features:

> What specific features do you want? (Is the site responsive?, etc.)

## Tools:

> Any tools or libraries that you want to use or research.


## Architecture:

> How will your CSS be structured? What modules? What framework?

You can build this section out based on looking at the design or wireframes, and then update and document the modules that you actually build. This provides a place for you to evaluate your CSS structure as you build out the front-end. Ultimately, you should move this into a styleguide that exists alongside the project. However, this is a great way to document and evaluate your front-end structure as you go.


## Notes & Ideas:

> Any and all notes or ideas.


## Issues:

> Any front-end issues that you need to document.

Is there an issue with your CSS architecture? Is the site not performant?

**Note**: If your working on a team, GitHub Issues would be a suitable replacement for this section.


## Team Log:

> Any sticking points or things that you want to log.

Generally, how did you solve the issues from above. This is a great way to build a case study to retrospectively look at the problems you found and ultimately solved in your front-end build.
